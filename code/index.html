      <p class="preamble">Simply put, <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> is a web-based platform for sharing and storing of code. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.</p>
      <h2>Quick facts</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>GitHub is a cloud-based code hosting platform for <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> - the free and open source distributed version control software that helps you manage and keep track of any changes that you make to your files.</li>
    <li>GitHub is great for collaboration as it makes it possible for you and your team mates to build code and make separate changes to the code at the same time without getting in each other's way.</li>
    <li>GitHub is also very useful for solo projects, as it provides the complete history of your project from beginning to end, the possibility to revert to any previous state of the code as well as the opportunity to track down and identify the origin of any new bug that is introduced to the code.</li>
  </ul>
